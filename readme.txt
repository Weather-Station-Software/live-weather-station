Display on your WordPress site, in many elegant ways, the meteorological data collected by public or personal weather stations.

== Description ==
Weather Station is a plugin that allows you to display, on your WordPress site, meteorological data from weather stations you have access to. It provides full support for many models of weather stations and for free or paid OpenWeatherMap and Weather Underground services&hellip;
Whether you own a weather station or not, you can enjoy the power of Weather Station!

You can find many demos and documentation on the [official website](https://weather.station.software/).

= Simple and efficient =
The use of Weather Station requires no knowledge in programming and does not requires writing code.
Just set it, insert (in a page or an article) the provided shortcodes. And it works!

= How does it work? =
Once you have connected the plugin to your weather stations (via the dashboard of your WordPress site), the data you have access to is collected regularly and stored in the database of your WordPress site.
The various controls and viewers now will get their data from this database with the certainty of having fresh and cached data.

To see all available widgets, controls and viewers, please take a look at the [live demo](https://weather.station.software/en/weather-station-in-action/).
