Display, in many different and elegant ways, the meteorological data collected by your Netatmo weather station or coming from OpenWeatherMap.

== Description ==

> Since 2.0 version of Live Weather Station plugin you can now display weather data even if you don't have a Netatmo station, simply by getting [a free OpenWeatherMap API key](http://openweathermap.org/appid). Of course, this plugin works always as well with all your Netatmo stations.


= Live Weather Station =
Live Weather Station is a plugin that allows you to display, on your WordPress site, meteorological data from the Netatmo weather stations you have access to. Initialy designed for Netatmo products, it provides now full support for free OpenWeatherMap services too...
To date, you can display data as follows:

* a "classical" configurable widget that displays outdoor weather data
* an "ephemeris" configurable widget that displays astronomical computed values
* a highly configurable LCD panel which displays selected weather data
* a highly configurable clean gauge control which displays the live weather data you have selected
* a hugely configurable steel meter control which displays the live weather data you have selected
* textual and numerical values you can insert in articles and pages via configurable shortcodes

To see it in action, go to the [demo page](https://pierre.lannoy.fr/wordpress-live-weather-station-for-netatmo-demo/).

= Simple and efficient =
The use of Live Weather Station requires no knowledge in programming and does not requires writing code.
Just set it, insert (in a page or an article) the provided shortcodes. And it works!

= How does it work? =
Once you have connected the plugin to your Netatmo account (via the dashboard of your WordPress site), the data you have access to (your stations, plus all those for which you have permission) are collected every 10 minutes and stored in the database of your WordPress site.
For OpenWeatherMap the process is the same: after entering your free API key, the weather data are collected every 15 minutes and stored in the database of your WordPress site.
The various controls and viewers (like widgets, LCD panel, gauges, etc.) now will get their data from this database with the certainty of having fresh and cached data.

= Supported data, devices & modules =
Live Weather Station supports all measured values coming from OpenWeatherMap excluding UV index, brightness and radiations.
It supports all current devices and modules from Netatmo. This includes, in addition to the main station base:

* indoor modules
* outdoor modules
* rain gauges
* wind gauges

= Supported languages =
Right now, Live Weather Station supports the following languages:

* English / default
* French

Multilingualism is provided by the use of .po files (the standard way), so it is fully translatable - by you - in your language. If you have translated this plugin in a new language, get in touch with me, I will include it in the next release or, if you want you can translate the plugin directly with [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/live-weather-station) (use the 'stable' column).

An effort from some members to begin the **german** translation have been done. If you speak german, you can contribute to this translation [here](https://translate.wordpress.org/locale/de/default/wp-plugins/live-weather-station) (choose 'stable' row) to finish it and include german language in the last release of the plugin.

= Instructions =
You can find a more in-depth description and instructions to configure [on this page](https://pierre.lannoy.fr/wordpress-live-weather-station-for-netatmo/).
