A plugin to display, in many different and elegant ways, the meteorological data collected by your Netatmo weather station.

== Description ==

**DISCLAIMER:** *This plugin is developed and maintained by me, [Pierre Lannoy](https://pierre.lannoy.fr "Pierre Lannoy"). This plugin IS NOT an official software from [Netatmo](http://www.netatmo.com "Netatmo Homepage") and is not endorsed or supported by this company.
Moreover, I am not a partner, employee, affiliate, or licensee of Netatmo. I'm just a happy customer/user of their products and a fan of meteorology.*

= Live Weather Station for Netatmo =
Live Weather Station for Netatmo is a plugin that allows you to display, on your WordPress site, meteorological data from the Netatmo weather stations you have access to.
To date, you can display data as follows:

* a "classical" widget that displays outdoor weather data
* a highly configurable LCD panel control which displays the data you have selected
* textual values you can insert in your articles and pages via configurable shortcodes

To see it in action, go to the [demo page](https://pierre.lannoy.fr/wordpress-live-weather-station-for-netatmo-demo/).

Note that more controls and viewers will be launched in the coming months.

= Simple and efficient =
The use of Live Weather Station for Netatmo requires no knowledge in programming and does not require writing code.
Just set it, insert (in a page or an article) the provided shortcodes. And it works!

= How does it work? =
Once you have connected the plugin to your Netatmo account (via the dashboard of your WordPress site), the data you have access to (your stations, plus all those for which you have permission) are collected every 10 minutes and stored in the database of your WordPress site.
The various controls and viewers (like widget or LCD Panel) now will get their data from this database with the certainty of having fresh and cached data.

= Supported devices & modules =
Live Weather Station for Netatmo supports all current devices and modules from Netatmo. This includes, in addition to the main station base:

* indoor modules
* outdoor modules
* rain gauges
* wind gauges

= Supported languages =
Right now, Live Weather Station support the following languages:

* English / default
* French

Multilingualism is provided by the use of .po files (the standard way), so it is fully translatable in your language. If you have translated this plugin in a new language, get in touch with me, I will include it in the next release or, if you want you can translate the plugin directly with [GlotPress](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/live-weather-station) (use the 'stable' column).
